The code is plain HTML without any server side execution. No user data is logged.   
The first iteration, published on April 2025, was written in the Atom text editor.    
The website is hosted on AWS as a simple static webiste on S3, using Cloudfront to handle the SSL redirection.    
As of April 2025 TextMate will be used for coding.
